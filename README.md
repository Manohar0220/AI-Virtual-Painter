AI Virtual Painter is a white board application but not a normal painting app it will work on your camera, as soon as you open it a camera will pop then you need to show your hand with all five fingers open use one finger for painting and two fingers for selection of brush and eraser.

Steps to run the code:
Make sure you install and import required libraries. And connect a camera to the laptop, as this application works on camera.
The application can make notes by recording the movement of hand from the camera. And there are different options to choose, that is selecting the color of paint and selecting the thickness of the brush.
The logical code of the application is written in such a way that when only single finger is open, it records that movement to paint it on the white board. And if two fingers are open, it records its movements to select the option like color, eraser, thickness etc.
We can even save the work done on the white board by closing all the fingers, which takes the screenshot and saves it to a particular folder.
